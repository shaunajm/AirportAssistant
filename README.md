# Airport Assistant

Airport Assistant is an Android Application to help users, primarily those who suffer from anxiety, with dealing with passing through an airport. According to travelweekly.co.uk a study conducted by CPP found that one third of people find a working week to be less stressful that taking a flight and a quarter say it would be less stressful to move house than to take a flight. The purpose of this application is to take the stress out of air travel and make it more accessible to people who avoid travelling due to fear of the panic it will cause. Airport Assistant works by, instead of overloading users with information about the airport, bringing them through the process step by step, completing checks, giving advice and providing important information. It is almost like someone holding the userâ€™s hand and being their assistant throughout the journey.

The primary feature of the application is the AR (Augmented Reality) functionality for measuring luggage sizes. This will help ease the worries of users who are concerned that their hand luggage may not meet the requirements of there airline before the leave home. Similarly, features such as security tips and walk times to gates will help make the entire process less stressful.
