#### Selecting a project idea

After much deliberation I have finally settled on a project idea. I hope to develop an android application to help people who are stressed by airports get through the experience. I came up with this idea as I myself get nervous in airports. The main feature of my project will utilise AR to detect whether a hand luggage bag is the correct dimensions for the user’s airline. I think this will be the toughest element of the project but I’m looking forward to learning more about it. I have asked Ray Walshe to be my supervisor and he has helped me nail down a final idea over the last number of days. I have submitted my project proposal and am now further investigating my project idea and preparing my proposal presentation.

#### Preparing for Project Proposal Presentations

I am currently preparing for my project proposal presentation which is tomorrow at 3pm. We have to prepare a 5 minute presentation and will be asked questions following this. I hope my project is approved so that I can get working on my Functional Specification and get into the building of my application.

#### Project approved

My Project Proposal presentation was today at 3pm. A group of five of us students presented our project ideas for Martin Crane and Charlie Daly. They seemed to like my project idea but expressed their worries that I was taking on a lot of work as my project has a lot of moving parts which must be integrated.

My project was approved with the feedback "Airport Assistant Good idea Issues: - Lot of moving parts (user interface design is key to ensure consistent usability) - Have sth to demo (Bag dimensions with ARSUite could be tough but have a fall-back: standard size)" Thankfully the project was approved but I will take this feedback onboard to assist me with my project in the future.

#### Meeting with Ray

Today I met with Ray for a supervisor meeting. He had a number of questions about my project and advice. He asked me to figure out what data is obtained from QR codes on boarding passes? To investigate if I will need to obtain Ethical Approval for my project. Draw UI Diagrams to help give myself a better idea of how my application will work. Investigate using Google Calendar and Google Drive to add features to my application and consider using the measuring algorithm to measure liquids.

I also wanted to ask him about using Firebase as a database and he agreed that as I am using a large amount of Google Software, progressing with Firebase made sense. He had read over my Functional Specification which I had emailed him earlier that day and liked it's standard. I uploaded my first draft of my Functional Specification to git today. I just have some minor changes to make before it is completed.

#### Update on Project Progress

We have a had a large amount of work for our semester one modules to complete so my project work has been hard to keep up with project work. I have investigated the some of topics which Ray had queries about and must arrange a meeting for next week. I have found out what data is taken from the QR codes on the boarding passes using the Google Pay API for Passes.

I also emailed a member of the school ethics committee to ask if I need to obtain Ethical Approval for my project. They said I do indeed need to due to the fact that I will be holding passenger data. I've also made some small changes to my Functional Specification which is now due on the 30th of November due to an extension.

#### Meeting 2 with Ray

I met with Ray today and we discussed the progress I had made since our last meeting. I informed him taht I wasn't too happy with the progress I had made as I had a lot of assignments at the moment and had not been able to a lot the time I had wished to my project. Ray understood this but recommended that I try to find some time over the next few months to get the bones of my project built that I could develop further at a later time and take some of the pressure off second semester.

 Ray read my Ethical Approval form and signed it which I, immediately after our meeting, scanned and sent off to the School's Ethical Approval committee. Hopefully this will be approved soon.

 As I mentioned earlier, I had completed research on elements of my project which Ray had asked me to look into. We talked about this research and took note of how it will affect future project work.

Overall, Ray was satisfied with my progress and we arranged to try and meet mid- January before semester 2 starts.

#### Functional Specification Submitted and UI Started

I was delighted that I got the time to spend most of the past weekend working on my project as I had made significant progress with my other assignments. After my meeting with Ray where he advised I get a prototype up and running by mid January which I can then further develop throughout the semester, I decided to begin developing the UI of my application.

Using my previously drawn UI diagrams I determined that at this moment my application will have 23 screens but this could change as I progress through the project. I created 23 java and 23 xml files this weekend and designed the skeleton UIs for 12 of my screens, these include login, home, check-in, security and duty free. I also added a progress bar to all 23 pages.

Functional Specifications were due last Friday and I had it submitted and read over a number of times before this. I am happy with my Functional Spec and am delighted I have made further progress on the project.
