#### Selecting a project idea

After much deliberation I have finally settled on a project idea. I hope to develop an android application to help people who are stressed by airports get through the experience. I came up with this idea as I myself get nervous in airports. The main feature of my project will utilise AR to detect whether a hand luggage bag is the correct dimensions for the user’s airline. I think this will be the toughest element of the project but I’m looking forward to learning more about it. I have asked Ray Walshe to be my supervisor and he has helped me nail down a final idea over the last number of days. I have submitted my project proposal and am now further investigating my project idea and preparing my proposal presentation.

#### Preparing for Project Proposal Presentations

I am currently preparing for my project proposal presentation which is tomorrow at 3pm. We have to prepare a 5 minute presentation and will be asked questions following this. I hope my project is approved so that I can get working on my Functional Specification and get into the building of my application.

#### Project approved

My Project Proposal presentation was today at 3pm. A group of five of us students presented our project ideas for Martin Crane and Charlie Daly. They seemed to like my project idea buut expressed their worries that I was taking on a lot of work as my project has a lot of moving parts which must be integrated. My project was approved with the feedback "Airport Assistant Good idea Issues: - Lot of moving parts (user interface design is key to ensure consistent usability) - Have sth to demo (Bag dimensions with ARSUite could be tough but have a fall-back: standard size)" Thankfully the project was approved but I will take this feedback onboard to assist me with my project in the future.

#### Meeting with Ray

Today I met with Ray for a supervisor meeting. He had a number of questions about my project and advice. He asked me to figure out what data is obtained from QR codes on boarding passes? To investigate if I will need to obtain Ethical Approval for my project. Draw UI Diagrams to help give myself a better idea of how my application will work. Investigate using Google Calendar and Google Drive to add features to my application and consider using the measuring algorithm to measure liquids. I also wanted to ask him about using Firebase as a database and he agreed that as I am using a large amount of Google Software, progressing with Firebase made sense. He had read over my Functional Specification which I had emailed him earlier that day and liked it's standard. I uploaded my first draft of my Functional Specification to git today. I just have some minor changes to make before it is completed.

#### Update on Project Progress

We have a had a large amount of work for our semester one modules to complete so my project work has been hard to keep up with project work. I have investigated the some of topics which Ray had queries about and must arrange a meeting for next week. I have found out what data is taken from the QR codes on the boarding passes using the Google Pay API for Passes. I also emailed a member of the school ethics committee to ask if I need to obtain Ethical Approval for my project. They said I do indeed need to due to the fact that I will be holding passenger data. I've also made some small changes to my Functional Specification which is now due on the 30th of November due to an extension.
