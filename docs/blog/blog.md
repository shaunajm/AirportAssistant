#### Selecting a project idea

After much deliberation I have finally settled on a project idea. I hope to develop an android application to help people who are stressed by airports get through the experience. I came up with this idea as I myself get nervous in airports. The main feature of my project will utilise AR to detect whether a hand luggage bag is the correct dimensions for the user’s airline. I think this will be the toughest element of the project but I’m looking forward to learning more about it. I have asked Ray Walshe to be my supervisor and he has helped me nail down a final idea over the last number of days. I have submitted my project proposal and am now further investigating my project idea and preparing my proposal presentation.

#### Preparing for Project Proposal Presentations

I am currently preparing for my project proposal presentation which is tomorrow at 3pm. We have to prepare a 5 minute presentation and will be asked questions following this. I hope my project is approved so that I can get working on my Functional Specification and get into the building of my application.
